# First Steps to Machine Learning in Python
The data for this project is available on Kaggle as part of the
[House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

## About the files in the dataset
The folder contains both training and test datasets. For the purposes of this
exercise, I'm only using the training dataset (The goal is to learn to split a
dataset into distinct training and test values).

## Goals of the script
* Demonstrate basic functionality in Pandas (subsetting, summary etc.)
* Extract features that could predict home prices (the features were selected
  based on simple logic without any regard for co-linearity)
* Create machine learning models using decision trees and random forest
   approaches to predict home prices
* Calculate mean absolute error of the test dataset compared to training dataset
* Find number of iterations of the model required to achieve perfect model

The script is available in the file LearnML.py

The approach is based on the tutorial by [Dan B](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/random-forests/data)
